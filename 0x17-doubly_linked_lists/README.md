# Doubly linked list

## Description

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list which points to both the previous and the next node.
Navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward each node of the list contains the address of its previous node, we can find all the details about the previous node as well by using the previous address stored inside the previous part of each node.
